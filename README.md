### You have deployed a web application targeting a global audience across multiple AWS Regions under the domain name.example.com. You decide to use Route 53 Latency-Based Routing to serve web requests to users from the region closest to the user. To provide business continuity in the event of server downtime you configure weighted record sets associated with two web servers in separate Availability Zones per region. Dunning a DR test you notice that when you disable all web servers in one of the regions Route 53 does not automatically direct all users to the other region. What could be happening? (Choose 2 answers)

### You've been hired to enhance the overall security posture for a very large e-commerce site They have a well architected multi-tier application running in a VPC that uses ELBs in front of both the web and the app tier with static assets served directly from S3 They are using a combination of RDS and DynamoOB for their dynamic data and then archiving nightly into S3 for further processing with EMR They are concerned because they found questionable log entries and suspect someone is attempting to gain unauthorized access. Which approach provides a cost effective scalable mitigation to this kind of attack?

- [ ] Recommend that they lease space at a DirectConnect partner location and establish a lG DirectConnect connection to their vPC they would then establish Internet connectivity into their space, filter the traffic in hardware Web Application Firewall (WAF).

- [ ] Add previously identified hostile source IPs as an explicit INBOUND DENY NACL to the web tier sub net.
- [x] Add a WAF tier by creating a new ELB and an AutoScaling group of EC2 Instances running a host based WAF They would redirect Route 53 to resolve to the new WAF tier ELB The WAF tier wouldthier pass the traffic to the current web tier The web tier Security Groups would be updated to only allow traffic from the WAF tier Security Group
- [ ] Remove all but TLS 1 2 from the web tier ELB and enable Advanced Protocol Filtering This will enable the ELB itself to perform WAF functionality.

### You need a persistent and durable storage to trace call activity of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. Call duration is mostly in the 2-3 minutes timeframe. Each traced call can be either active or terminated. An external application needs to know each minute the list of currently active calls, which are usually a few calls/second. Put once per month there is a periodic peak up to 1000 calls/second for a few hours. The system is open 24/7 and any downtime should be avoided. Historical data is periodically archived to files. Cost saving is a priority for this project. What database implementation would better fit this scenario, keeping costs as low as possible?

- [x] Use RDS Multi-AZ with two tables, one for 'Active calls' and one for 'Terminated calls'. in this way the 'Active calls' table is always small and effective to access.
- [ ] Use DynamoDB with a 'Calls' table and a Global Secondary Index on a 'lsActive' attribute that is present for active calls only in this way the Global Secondary index is sparse and more effective.
- [ ] Use DynamoDB with a 'Calls' table and a Global secondary index on a 'State' attribute that can equal to 'active' or 'terminated' in this way the Global Secondary index can be used for all Items in the table.
- [ ] Use RDS Multi-AZ with a 'CALLS' table and an Indexed 'STATE* field that can be equal to 'ACTIVE' or 'TERMINATED' in this way the SOL query Is optimized by the use of the Index.

### You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached. The EC2 instance is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS. The four EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID 0 device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4,000IOPS (4,000 16KB reads or writes), for a total of 16,000 random IOPS on the instance. The EC2 instance initially delivers the expected 16,000 IOPS random read and write performance. Sometime later, in order to increase the total random I/O performance of the instance, you add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes to the RAID. Each volume is provisioned to 4,000 IOPs like the original four, for a total of 24,000 IOPS on the EC2 instance. Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%, but the total random IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all. What is the problem and a valid solution?

- [ ] Larger storage volumes support higher Provisioned IOPS rates; increase the provisioned volume storage of each of the 6 EBS volumes to 1TB.
- [x] The EBS-Optimized throughput limits the total IOPS that can be utilized; use an EBS Optimized instance that provides larger throughput. Mo
- [ ] Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I/O throughput; configure the instance device driver and filesystem to use 64KB blocks to increase throughput.
- [ ] The standard EBS Instance root volume limits the total IOPS rate; change the instance root volume to also be a 500GB 4,000 Provisioned IOPS volume.
- [ ] RAID 0 only scales linearly to about 4 devices; use RAID 0 with 4 EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes, but increase each Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to 6,000 IOPS.

### You are migrating a legacy client-server application to AWS. The application responds to a specific DNS domain (e.g. <www.example.com>) and has a 2-tier architecture, with multiple application servers and a database server.

### You have recently joined a startup company building sensors to measure street noise and air quality in urban areas. The company has been running a pilot deployment of around 100 sensors for 3 months each sensor uploads 1KB of sensor data every minute to a backend hosted on AWS. During the pilot, you measured a peak or 10 IOPS on the database, and you stored an average of 3GB of sensor data per month in the database. The current deployment consists of a load-balanced auto scaled Ingestion layer using EC2 instances and a PostgreSQL RDS database with 500GB standard storage. The pilot is considered a success and your CEO has managed to get the attention or some potential investors.

You configure the proxy to only pass through traffic to domains that you define in its whitelist configuration You have a nightly maintenance window or 10 minutes where all instances fetch new software updates. Each update Is about 200MB in size and there are 500 instances in theVPC that routinely fetch updates After a few days you notice that some machines are failing to successfully download some, but not all of their updates within the maintenance window. The download URLs used for these updates are correctly listed in the proxy's whitelist configuration and you are able to access them manually using a web browser on the instances. What might be happening? (Choose 2 answers)

- [x] You are running the proxy on an undersized EC2 instance type so network throughput is not sufficient for all instances to download their updates in time.
- [x] You are running the proxy on a sufficiently-sized EC2 instance in a private subnet and its network throughput is being throttled by a NAT running on an undersized EC2 instance.
- [ ] The route table for the subnets containing the affected EC2 instances is not configured to direct network traffic for the software update locations to the proxy.
- [ ] You have not allocated enough storage to t he EC2 instance running the proxy so the network buffer is filling up, causing some requests to fail.
- [ ] You are running the proxy in a public subnet but have not allocated enough EIPs to support the needed network throughput through the Internet Gateway (IGW).

### A web-startup runs its very successful social news application on Amazon EC2 with an Elastic Load Balancer, an Auto-Scaling group of Java/Tomcat application-servers, and DynamoDB as data store. The main web-application best runs on m2 x large instances since it is highly memory- bound Each new deployment requires semi-automated creation and testing of a new AMI for the application servers which takes quite a while ana is therefore only done once per week. Recently, a new chat feature has been implemented in nodejs and wails to be integrated in the architecture. First tests show that the new component is CPU bound Because the company has some experience with using Chef, they decided to streamline the deployment process and use AWS OpsWorks as an application life cycle tool to simplify management of the application and reduce the deployment cycles. What configuration in AWS OpsWorks is necessary to integrate the new chat module in the most cost-efficient and flexible way?
